### Type Safety

The project uses comprehensive TypeScript types extracted from the original game code, ensuring type safety for:
- Game board state
- Card definitions and modifiers
- Action types and validation
- API requests and responses
- Game events and messages

### Code Style

- Modern ES modules
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Functional programming patterns
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the game server is accessible
- Try creating a new game if joining fails

### Game State Issues
- The client automatically retries on connection errors
- Game state is rebuilt from event history
- Use Ctrl+C to exit gracefully

### Action Errors
- Ensure you select valid actions from the provided list
- Some actions may become invalid between display and selection
- The server will reject invalid actions safely
